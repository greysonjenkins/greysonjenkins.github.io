    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I graduated from Pepperdine University in 2023 with a dual degree in Computer Science and Philosophy and a minor
      in Great Books.
      My academic work includes co‐authoring research on computer‐vision models for computer‐assisted medical
      diagnostics.<label for="sn-diagnostics" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

      <span class="sidenote">
        <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9707056">"Weakly-Supervised Convolutional Neural Networks for
          Vessel Segmentation in Cerebral Angiography"</a>
      </span>
      Professionally, I have worked as a Data Science Intern at a leading healthcare technology company, applying ML
      methods to identify new client leads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, at Pepperdine, I was an undergraduate research fellow at the Keck Institute for Data Science<label

      and a regular volunteer at Pepperdine's annual Human-Centered AI conference.<label for="sn-hcai"

      I differentiate myself from other thinkers through my formal education in computer science, philosophy, and
      studying the Great Books.
      At Pepperdine, I was trained in the analytic tradition, with philosophy classes emphasizing symbolic logic and
      computer science classes emphasizing discrete mathematics and computation theory.
      Consequently, where most developers and data scientists advertise their experience at the intersection of multiple
      fields, I stand out due to my training in the union of multiple fields.
