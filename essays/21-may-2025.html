        <h2>Is Stoicism Defensible? (WIP)</h2>
        <h3>21 May 2025</h3>
        <p>
            On the surface, several aspects of Stoicism can seem coarse, or even outright morally objectionable.
            The Stoic premises that virtue is the only good, and that all external things are indifferent, can seem to result in some unpleasant moral conclusions.
            Stoicism is, at its core, a relatively hardcore philosophy. And as one of my former philosophy professors would frequently remind his students,
            "It's hard to be hardcore." So, if Stoicism is so hardcore, how has it maintained relevance for so long? 
            And if it seems to encourage people to steel their hearts and effectively become emotionless robots, how could it possibly be a good thing?
            Is there any promising defense for Stoicism in the 21st century? I will advance an argument that Stoicism, on the traditional understanding, is defensible, 
            though the contemporary may be untenable.

                    If you kiss your child or your wife, say to yourself that it is a human being that you're kissing,
                    and then, if one of them should die, you won't be upset.

            Easy, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, the core principles of Stoicism have proven to be among the most enduring ideas in mainstream Western culture.
            And thanks to modern bestellers that have directly drawn from Stoic ideas, condensing thousands of years of nuanced philosophcal 
            discourse into more accessible, much shorter self-help books, it has seen a resurgence in popularity even among non-philosophical 
            audiences. Though the Stoic revival might seem strange in light of the general public's view of philosophy's usefulness 
            (or perceived lack thereof), its return to public awareness is hardly surprising after closer examination.
        </p>
        <p>
            The elevator-pitch appeal of Stoicism is understandable enough: On the surface, it appears to possess a level practicality and simplicity that 
            other philosophical traditions, like Platonism, are thought to lack. Stoicism's approach to dealing with hardship in life is 
            highly relevant in the modern world, where we face a non-stop barrage of stressors beyond our control. The apparent practicality 
            and simplicity of Stoicism, however, contribute to a sense that the philosophy is also easy to apply in practice; and that makes 
            for the ideal kind of fodder ready to be repackaged and resold as part of the contemporary self-help movement, in banal platitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, to some extent, isn't all ancient philosophy just extra-complicated self-help?
