        <h2>Are Stoic Ethics Defensible? (WIP)</h2>
        <h3>21 May 2025</h3>
        <p>
            On the surface, several aspects of Stoicism can seem coarse, or even outright morally objectionable.
            The Stoic premises on virtue as the only good, and that all external things are indifferent, entails some challenging moral conclusions.

        <div class="epigraph">
            <blockquote>
                <p>With regard to everything that is a source of delight to you, or is useful to you, or of which you
                    are fond, remember to keep telling yourself what kind of thing it is . . .
                    If you kiss your child or your wife, say to yourself that it is a human being that you're kissing,
                    and then, if one of them should die, you won't be upset.
                </p>

            And yet, Stoicism's loosely-connected core philosophical principles have proven to be
            one of the most enduring schools of thought in contemporary Western culture.
            To this day, it remains one of the most widely-known movements in the history of philosophy even amongst
            non-philosophers, though that popularity is hardly surprising. The elevator-pitch appeal of Stoicism is
            understandable enough:
            On the surface, it appears to possess a level practicality and simplicity that other philosophical schools,
            like Platonism, are thought to lack.
            That practicality and simplicity, however, has made Stoicism ideal fodder for distilling (and reducing) its
            fundamental principles into the kinds of banal platitudes comprising contemporary Stoic self-help books.
