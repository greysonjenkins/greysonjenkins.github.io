                <p>With regard to everything that is a source of delight to you, or is useful to you, or of which you
                    are fond, remember to keep telling yourself what kind of thing it is . . .
                    If you kiss your child or your wife, say to yourself that it is a human being that you're kissing,
                    and then, if one of them should die, you won't be upset.
                </p>
