        <h2>Are Stoic Ethics Defensible? (WIP)</h2>
        <h3>21 May 2025</h3>
        <p>
            On the surface, several aspects of Stoicism can seem coarse, or even outright morally objectionable.
            The Stoic premises that virtue is the only good, and that all external things are indifferent, can seem to result in some unpleasant moral conclusions.
            Stoicism is, at its core, a relatively hardcore philosophy. And as one of my former philosophy professors freuqently reminded us students,
            "It's hard to be hardcore."
        </p>
        <div class="epigraph">
            <blockquote>
                <p>With regard to everything that is a source of delight to you, or is useful to you, or of which you
                    are fond, remember to keep telling yourself what kind of thing it is . . .
                    If you kiss your child or your wife, say to yourself that it is a human being that you're kissing,
                    and then, if one of them should die, you won't be upset.
                </p>

            And yet, Stoicism's loosely-connected core philosophical principles have proven to be
            among the most enduring in mainstream Western culture. To this day, thanks to several modern bestellers drawing on Stoic 
            themes and condensing thousands of years of nuanced philosophcal discourse into more accessible, much shorter self-help books.
            In turn, Stoicism has seen a surge in popularity as its ideas propogated rapidly even among non-philosophical audiences, but 
            that popularity is hardly surprising. The elevator-pitch appeal of Stoicism is understandable enough:
            On the surface, it appears to possess a level practicality and simplicity that other philosophical schools,
            like Platonism, are thought to lack.
            That practicality and simplicity, however, has made Stoicism ideal fodder for distilling (and reducing) its
            fundamental principles into the kinds of banal platitudes that generally comprise contemporary Stoic self-help books.
